## Abstract

This project develops a domain-specific compiler front-end for analyzing Python code written in the Tiferet framework’s Command pattern — a highly regular dialect that embodies Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Clean Architecture layering. In enterprise software development, domain experts define critical business requirements that must be faithfully translated into features and reliably implemented, tested, and maintained by cross-functional teams. DDD addresses this challenge through a shared ubiquitous language, which Tiferet realizes via interdependent object families: artifact comments as domain documentation, Command inheritance as service boundary, execute methods as transactional use-case orchestration, injected service contracts as infrastructure abstraction, model factories as aggregate roots, and error codes as domain vocabulary.
The compiler performs lexical analysis to recognize Tiferet idioms (artifact sections, import groups, validation keywords), syntactic analysis via Python’s ast module to extract Command classes and ordered execute snippets, and semantic analysis to resolve dependencies while enforcing DDD architectural rules. The resulting intermediate representation — a single consolidated YAML file capturing parameter contracts, ordered execution flow, and aggregated domain dependencies — serves as a semantically rich context store. This IR powers enhanced, AI-assisted conversion into high-quality dependency visualizations in Mermaid and Graphviz DOT formats, where the contextual depth improves layout clarity, edge labeling, and relational insight beyond generic extraction. The implementation demonstrates core compiler design methodologies — phase separation, domain-specific tokenization, AST-based analysis, semantic resolution, and multi-target code generation — applied to a production DDD framework. A public repository (tiferet-command-parser-edu) documents the process for the Command pattern only, serving as an educational artifact while preserving broader extensions for future inquiry.
